## When to use
Use this skill for implementing new features that touch multiple parts of the stack (e.g., a new page with API + UI + 3D content).

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Plan
Use `@plan` primary agent to design the feature:
- Define API contracts (request/response shapes)
- Define component tree and data flow
- Identify content types needed
- Document the plan as an ADR via `@docs`

### Phase 2: Implement
Dispatch implementation in dependency order:

**Independent (parallel):**
- `@backend-dev` — Endpoints, services, DTOs, tests
- `@cms-dev` — Content types, permissions, seed data
- `@3d-engineer` — 3D scenes/components (if applicable)

**Dependent (sequential):**
- `@frontend-dev` — Pages, components (needs API types + 3D components)
- `@devops` — Config changes if infra changes needed

### Phase 3: Quality
Run full quality gate:
- `@qa` — Lint → typecheck → test → E2E → Lighthouse
- `@security-auditor` — Security review
- `@accessibility-engineer` — a11y audit
- `@performance-engineer` — Performance review

### Phase 4: Document
- `@docs` — Update API docs, component docs, changelog

### Phase 5: Wrap
Summarize what was built, what was tested, and any follow-up items.
